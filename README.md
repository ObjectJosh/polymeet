## Overview

PolyMeet is a chatting platform all about bringing Cal Poly SLO students closer together. By requiring a "calpoly.edu" email for sign-ups, we make sure every interaction is safe and genuine. It's not just about finding study buddies or club matesâ€”PolyMeet is here to enrich your college experience by connecting you with fellow students who share your passions, all through a platform that feels personal and tailored just for you.
